After downloading the DNA Payments WooCommerce plugin from GitHub, it would be advisable to rename the zip file to "wc-dnapayments.zip" before uploading and installing it.


This is the fix for the draft orders issue that DNA didn't let us release!
The updated plugin is called "WooCommerce DNA Payments Gateway by Zap" and the version is 3.0.15_ZAP
Note, before updating, load this page /wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=checkout&section=dnapayments and  verify the settings match after updating the plugin
